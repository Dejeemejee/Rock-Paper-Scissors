# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a simple game created solely using the javascript programming language. In a single round of the game, A Player is prompted with a text-box to input their preferred choice , which is then played against the computer's choice that is randomly generated by the computer. Five rounds make-up a single game. The game ends with a short message describing three possible outcomes- the player wins and the computer looses, the computer wins and the player loses or it's well..... a tie!!!!
